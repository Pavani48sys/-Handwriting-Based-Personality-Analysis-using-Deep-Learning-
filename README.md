# -Handwriting-Based-Personality-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning-
This project implements a rule-based system to analyze handwriting and predict personality traits based on image processing techniques. Inspired by the principles of graphology, it uses OpenCV and Python to extract features such as slant, letter size, spacing, and pressure from handwritten text images.
